<a href="https://www.notabli.com/" target="_blank">Notabli</a> is a place to privately share photos, videos, quotes, and audio recordings of your kids with family & friends.

My relationship with Notabli started after the initial release of their iOS application. I started working with them as a freelance contractor and worked only on the iOS application.

After the release of iOS 7 and the change in the design guidelines the team at Notabli decided to give the app a visual lift. I helped them bring all those designs to life and also worked on new media pickers for each of the media types the app supports.

I was involved in this project for a long time and I enjoyed every bit of it.
