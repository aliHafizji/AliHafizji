BioBeatsâ€™ machine learning platform delivers biometric insight about the wellbeing of individuals, employees and patients in real-time, and helps them action that insight through engaging media.

While working as a contractor for Monsoon, I had the previlege to build the early version of the 12 Breaths application. This application was developed using the technology provided by the folks at BioBeats. 

Using that we were able to measure the heart rate of the user using the camera and the flash light. The data collected was shown to the user in the form of an interactive graph. The application was built for the iPhone and I followed the agile process during the entire development cycle. We had weekly releases and daily standups to discuss progress and blockers.
