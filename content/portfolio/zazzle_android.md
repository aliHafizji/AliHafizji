Zazzle is an online marketplace that allows designers and customers to create their own products using their product customization tool.

While working at Monsoon, I worked with a small team of developers to build the Android version of Zazzle. I worked on this project right from inception to release and was a part of all the important technical decisions.

I spent most of my time working on building different UI components for the Android app. You can find it here on the Google Play store.
