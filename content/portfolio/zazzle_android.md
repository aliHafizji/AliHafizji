<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/" target="_blank">Zazzle</a> is an online marketplace that allows designers and customers to create their own products using their product customization tool.

While working at <a href="http://www.kunaiconsulting.com/">Monsoon</a>, I worked with a small team of developers to build the Android version of Zazzle. I worked on this project right from inception to release and was a part of all the important technical decisions.

I spent most of my time working on building different UI components for the Android app. You can find it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zazzle&hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> on the Google Play store.
