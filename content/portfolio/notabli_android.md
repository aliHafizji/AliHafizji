<a href="https://www.notabli.com/" target="_blank">Notabli</a> is a place to privately share photos, videos, quotes, and audio recordings of your kids with family & friends.

Having the privilege of working with Notabli on their iOS application, I was immediately interested when I heard about their delve into the world of Android.

I came on board as a contract Android developer after the first version of the application was developed. During my tenure I worked extensively on the networking layer, performance, adding a unit test suite and also built the inline video player.

It's always fun to work with a team that is motivated to improve the product. Since, they already had a set process and communication channels that they followed internally I adapted to use the same as soon as I joined.

Here is a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notabli" target="_blank">link</a> to the application in the Google Play Store.
