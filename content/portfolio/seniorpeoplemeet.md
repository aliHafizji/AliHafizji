SeniorPeopleMeet.com is a community specially designed to cater to senior singles seeking mature dating. It helps people discover a vibrant senior community of mature adults in which to make a senior connection.

While working with Monsoon as a contractor I worked on the SeniorPeopleMeet project. I helped build the iOS application. The application was written in Swift 1.0 which was later upgraded to the latest version with every release from Apple.

I focused on building the networking layer and also helped build a large number of UI elements. We later converted the networking layer into an internal cocoapod and also added support for themes.

You can find the application on the Appstore.
