<a href="http://www.seniorpeoplemeet.com/" target="_blank">SeniorPeopleMeet</a> is a community specially designed to cater to senior singles seeking mature dating. It helps people discover a vibrant senior community of mature adults in which to make a senior connection.

While working with <a href="http://www.kunaiconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Monsoon</a> as a contractor I worked on the SeniorPeopleMeet project. I helped build the iOS application. The application was written in Swift 1.0 which was later upgraded to the latest version with every release from Apple.

I focused on building the networking layer and also helped build a large number of UI elements. We later converted the networking layer into an internal cocoapod and also added support for themes.

You can find the application on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/senior-people-meet-1-dating/id969533164?mt=8" target="_blank">Appstore</a>.
