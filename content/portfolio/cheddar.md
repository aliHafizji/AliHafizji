<a href="https://cheddarapp.com/" target="_blank">Cheddar</a> is an amazing Todo list application developed for the iPhone and Mac OS platforms. Everything you do with Cheddar pushes to all of your devices, so your world is always in sync.

This application was developed by the folks at <a href="http://nothingmagical.com/" target="_blank">Nothing Magical</a>. At that time there was no such application available for Android. Since their API was public I decided to write the Android version of Cheddar.
I had a blast working on this project as I was not only handling the technical aspect but also designed the user experience for both tablet and phone form factors. The application was built as a side project and it took around two weeks to design, develop and release.

Since, the iOS application was open sourced. I decided to open source the Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativeperson.cheddar" target="_blank">app</a> as well. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/aliHafizji/Cheddar-Android" target="_blank">here</a>.
